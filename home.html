    <p id="review4" class="reviews">At the end of high school, I went through a rough path. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and I was even more at a loss when trying to find a career path. I decided to take a gap year, but the results were not as I wished. Instead of “finding out what I wanted to do” I got a low-paying job where I could not even afford to move out of my parents’ home. I was lost. Then I discovered the PathFinder app which allowed me to put my life back on track. I ended up taking a 12-week certificate program where I learned about graphic design. I thought this was going to be my career, but then I got a new career suggestion: game designing. As I read through what this entailed, I instantly became interested. With my newly acquired graphic design skills and PathFinder, I ended up getting a full-time job offer for game design at Disney. PathFinder helped me straighten my life out, and for that, I am grateful. I would recommend PathFinder to anyone who is struggling to find their path.</p>
